Hello world! I’m **Adil Zouitine** a **boring guy** who does boring things. I’m a **Research Engineer** in machine learning at IRT Saint-Exupery. I’m currently working on Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (MARL) and its game theory implications. My university background is a mix of **applied mathematics** and **computer science**. In my spare time I enjoy contributing to open source projects and participating in machine learning competitions. Apart from coding, I like spending time with friends, reading manga — I’m a huge One Piece fan — and practicing combat sports.

If you want to contact me send me a DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AdilZtn) or by [email](mailto:adilzouitinegm@gmail.com). :smile:
