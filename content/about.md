Hello world,
I'm Adil Zouitine a boring guy who does things.
I'm Research engineer in machine learning at IRT Saint-Exupery. My current work is on Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (MARL) with Game Theory.
My university background is a mix of mathematics and computer science.
I like to do open source and machine learning competitions on my free time.
Apart from coding, I like spending time with my friends, reading manga (I'm a big fan of One Piece) and practicing fighting sports.

If you want to contact me send me a DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AdilZtn) or by [email](mailto:adilzouitinegm@gmail.com). :smile:
